# Movie Data Analysis Project

## Introduction
This project involves cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing a dataset of movies using SQL Server and Tableau Public. The dataset includes various attributes such as title, release date, genres, popularity, and ratings.

## Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the movie dataset.
- Perform exploratory data analysis to uncover trends and patterns.
- Create interactive visualizations to present insights.

## Data Cleaning
The data cleaning phase involved:
- Removing duplicates
- Handling missing values
- Standardizing data formats
- Filtering out irrelevant data

## Data Analysis
Various SQL queries were used to analyze the data, including:
- Counting total movies
- Calculating average ratings and popularity
- Aggregating data by genre and year

## Visualizations
The following visualizations were created using Tableau Public:
- **Number of Movies by Genre**: Shows the distribution of movies across different genres.
- **Total Popularity by Year**: Highlights the trend in movie popularity over the years.
- **Movie Ratings vs. Popularity**: Displays the relationship between movie ratings and popularity.
- **Average Rating by Genre**: Shows the average rating for each genre.

## Files
- `movies.sql`: SQL script to create the database, clean the data, and perform analysis.
- `movies_cleaned.csv`: Cleaned data file.
- `MoviesDashboard.twb`: Tableau workbook with visualizations.

## Dashboard
The interactive dashboard can be viewed on Tableau Public:

## Conclusion
The analysis provided insights into the distribution of movie genres, trends in movie popularity over the years, and the relationship between movie ratings and popularity.

## How to Use
1. **SQL Scripts**: Run the `movies.sql` script to create and populate the database.
2. **Data Analysis**: Use the SQL queries in the script to perform various analyses.
3. **Visualization**: Open the `MoviesDashboard.twb` file in Tableau Public to view the visualizations.
